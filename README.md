#### Behooves

“Code is expensive. Writing it costs time or money. It therefore behooves you to be as efficient as possible. The most cost-effective code is as good as necessary, but no better.”

Excerpt From: Sandi Metz, Katrina Owen. “99 Bottles of OOP.” Apple Books. 

#### Exigent/Exigent Circumstances
> Jeh Johnson, DHS secretary under the Obama administration, told NPR earlier this month that he couldn’t say that family separations “never happened” during his tenure. “There may have been some [**exigent**](https://www.google.com/search?q=exigent) situation, some emergency. There may have been some doubt about whether the adult accompanying the child was in fact the parent of the child. I can’t say it never happened but not as a matter of policy or practice. It’s not something that I could ask our Border Patrol or our immigration enforcement personnel to do,” Johnson said.

#### Intensify the Contradictions
> There was one candidate this week who I think did not distinguish himself, and that was Bernie Sanders. The House Democrats came out with a bill that would patch up some of the holes in Obamacare: that would broaden coverage - Paul Krugman in today's New York Times said, It might increase coverage coverage for a million more people* - and would give give subsidies to the middle class, and more subsidies to the poor to deal with these tremendous premiums people are paying. Bernie Sanders said he was against it. Why? He said, "I am not going to incremental changes any more. I want my plan. I want - you know - the clean slate. I want to begin again." You know, that is a position students of revolutionary movements will find familiar. The Marxists call it **Intensify the Contradictions**. They don't want to intervene in anything to make something better because it's the feeling that things are hopeless that will contribute to the "let's have Berniecare; let's have a complete upheaval in health care."

> Knowing my adversary, I could easily lock him out in a way that would mystify him. I built a trapdoor into our Elxsi: whenever the hacker touched the [**purloined**](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/purloin) accounts on that machine, it notified me and pretended to be too busy to accept another user.
