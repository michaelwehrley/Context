#### Purloin
> Knowing my adversary, I could easily lock him out in a way that would mystify him. I built a trapdoor into our Elxsi: whenever the hacker touched the [**purloined**](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/purloin) accounts on that machine, it notified me and pretended to be too busy to accept another user.

#### Intensify the Contradictions
> There was one candidate this week who I think did not distinguish himself, and that was Bernie Sanders. The House Democrats came out with a bill that would patch up some of the holes in Obamacare: that would broaden coverage - Paul Krugman in today's New York Times said, It might increase coverage coverage for a million more people* - and would give give subsidies to the middle class, and more subsidies to the poor to deal with these tremendous premiums people are paying. Bernie Sanders said he was against it. Why? He said, "I am not going to incremental changes any more. I want my plan. I want - you know - the clean slate. I want to begin again." You know, that is a position students of revolutionary movements will find familiar. The Marxists call it **Intensify the Contradictions**. They don't want to intervene in anything to make something better because it's the feeling that things are hopeless that will contribute to the "let's have Berniecare; let's have a complete upheaval in health care."
